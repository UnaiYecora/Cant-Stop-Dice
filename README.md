# Can't Stop Dice
### Automatic dice roller to play Can't Stop
I just made this simple android/web dice roller for [Can't Stop](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/41/cant-stop). It's just a little app that lets you roll four dices and it gives you the possible combinations.
If you don't want to do the math (or you don't have dices at hand), this is for you.

##### Now on the Play Store! [Download](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.unaiyecora.cantstopdice) (Update: this version is now outdated; it might work, but you should use the web version instead).

Web version: http://unaiyecora.github.io/Cant-Stop-Dice/ (mirror: http://unaiyecora.com/sandbox/CantStopDice/)
