# Can't Stop Dice
### Automatic dice roller to play Can't Stop
I just made this simple android dice roller for Can't Stop. It's just a little app that lets you roll four dices and it gives you the possible combinations.
If you don't want to do the math (or you don't have dices at hand), this is for you.

You can find the last releases (and an untested Windows Phone app) here: https://build.phonegap.com/apps/1741190/

I haven't tested it on different devices yet, so I'd truly appreciate it if you could tell me if it works (or not) on your phone.

Feedback is also very very welcome.
